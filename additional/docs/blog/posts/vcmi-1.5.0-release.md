# VCMI 1.5.0 released

A new major release has been published. VCMI 1.5.0 sees the light of day. The main focus this time was on the online lobby. But also many other features were integrated and many bugs were fixed.

<!-- more -->

## Online multiplayer support
VCMI now has an online lobby that can be used to set up multiplayer sessions. But you can also interact with other players. The lobby works on all platforms and regardless of firewall restrictions. It can be opened at any time on desktop systems with `CTRL + Tab` and on mobile platforms with a three-finger touch.

## More natural looking random maps
A new biome system for random maps has been integrated. This makes created maps look much more natural.

## Most remaining campaign issues fixed
Many different problems and bugs related to campaigns have been fixed. 

## Basic game controllers support added
It is now possible to play VCMI with a game controller. Both on PC-based platforms and on mobile platforms.

## And much more
In addition, many other features and fixes have been integrated, which were requested by the community. See the complete [changelog](https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi/blob/master/ChangeLog.md#145---150)

We are delighted that you are entering the world of Enroth via VCMI. The journey has been a long one, but we are far from finished and will continue to improve VCMI.
